# WGU-RE
Some quick toy programs written mostly in python to show some programming techniques and practice reversing.  This was a bit of a back and forth between me and Ody.  Some have been solved by other club members as well.

Most are pretty straight forward. The flag format is modeled after the NCL format.  Thus the flags will all be WGU-XXXX-1234
That's the letters WGU, a hyphen, four uppercase letters, a hyphen, and four numbers.

I personally have not solved the WGU.dat file.  But the flag should be the same format.

The only thing that is really any different is the "ruby_levl1_follow_up.py"  This code does not function as is.  The point was to show how hard it can be to try to trace a problem when using recursion.  So, solve the ruby lvl1.rb if you are just hunting for flags.  Try to make the proper edits to run the follow_up if you want to practice your python debugging skills.

Lastly, to my knowledge, no one has solved the flag.gif challenge.  Please ping me on the club discord if you do.  I'd love to get feedback on what you liked or didn't like about it.
